I just wanna shine
Like the sun when it comes up
Run the city from the rooftops
'Cause today's gonna be my day
I just wanna climb
To the top of a mountain
Standing tall when I'm howling
'Cause today's gonna be my
—day's gonna be my
—day's, —day's, —day's, —day's, —day's

Goodnight stress, I'll see you in the morning
I don't gotta guess, you're always there for me
Sowing them seeds of doubt
I think you like seeing me freak out
Goodnight stress, I'll see you in the morning

So I wake up
I get out of bed, and stay up
Stay out of my head
'Cause it's dangerous
And I don't wanna lose my mind, no

I just wanna shine
Like the sun when it comes up
Run the city from the rooftops
'Cause today's gonna be my day
I just wanna climb
To the top of a mountain
Standing tall when I'm howling
'Cause today's gonna be my day

I used to lay low, hiding in the shadows
So don't give me dark days, I already had those
I'm just tryna figure out how to be myself right now
I don't wanna lay low, hiding in the shadows

So I wake up (wake up)
I get out of bed, and stay up (just say up)
Stay out of my head
'Cause it's dangerous (too dangerous)
And I don't wanna lose my mind, no

I just wanna shine
Like the sun when it comes up
Run the city from the rooftops
'Cause today's gonna be my day
I just wanna climb
To the top of a mountain
Standing tall when I'm howling
'Cause today's gonna be my day

(Is it gonna go)

I wake up and I
Stay up 'cause I'm
Sure good things will happen
If I get out of my way

I just wanna shine (I just wanna shine)
Like the sun when it comes up (when the sun comes up)
Run the city from the rooftops (run it from the rooftops)
Cause today's gonna be my day (—day's gonna be my day)
I just wanna climb (I just wanna climb)
To the top of a mountain (top of a mountain)
Standing tall when I'm howling (tall when I'm howling)
Cause today's gonna be my day (—day's gonna be my day)
